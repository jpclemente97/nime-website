The following document will explain the steps on how to add and format new CSV files to the Exchange tables on the NIME website.


* Delete the necessary columns of the CSV file in your preferred spreadsheet editor (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)
* For images and videos to be visible, set the “general access” permissions to “anyone with the link” on google drive
* Place the CSV file(s) in the “assets” folder
* If you’d like to make a column narrower, you can consider manually adding a new line character (‘\n’) in the table body at a specified point using custom formatting. For instance, on the “Full Table” markdown file, the “atAndDotReplacement” also adds a new line character before the “_at_” in an email address.
